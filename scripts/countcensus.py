"""The count census, as a library: check declared claims, then refuse an
unaccounted count-shaped integer.

This module holds the MECHANISM. It holds no claim, no source path, no frozen
figure and no vocabulary about any particular corpus, because a second consumer
now runs the same rule over a different subject and two implementations of one
rule drifting apart is the defect class this repository has hit most often.

scripts/count-gate.py is the first consumer and its header argues the design at
length -- why the published counts are CHECKED and never emitted, why a census
is needed on top of the declared claims, what makes an integer count-shaped, the
five routes by which one is accounted for, and what the whole arrangement still
cannot catch. Read that file, not this one, for the argument. What follows here
is only what a consumer has to supply.

A consumer supplies four things:

  Quantities   what the sources currently publish (value -> what it is), what
               they have published before (value -> the attributions carrying
               it), and any exact figure some ledger records verbatim.
  the texts    the tracked files to read, from ``read_tracked``.
  Census       the masking rules, the count nouns, the small-value vocabulary,
               and the accounting routes that are not spans.
  declarations the Claim, Delegated and Frozen tables, which are statements
               somebody made on purpose about that consumer's own prose.

Nothing here reads a repository by itself. Every path arrives as an argument, so
a consumer may point the census at its own tree, at a sibling's, or at a staged
copy, and the gate's own tests can mutate a copy without touching the tree they
are testing.

    WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-27). Every read here used to be `open()` on the
    working tree, and a lane worktree is now a SPARSE checkout: full checkouts
    are refused once a disk is under its floor, so a lane materialises only the
    paths it edits. A tracked file outside the cone is in the index and in HEAD
    and absent from disk, and the census died on it with FileNotFoundError --
    which blocked every send from every sparse lane, since the consumer gate
    reads the whole outbound set, not only the lane's own files. Skipping the
    absent file is not a repair: the census would then under-count and pass.

    THE RULE FOR WHICH BYTES A PATH READS AS:

      * present on disk as a regular file -> the DISK bytes. An unmodified file
        is byte-identical to its blob, so this changes nothing for it; a file
        with an uncommitted edit -- the body a send is about to post -- is read
        as edited, which is what every consumer read before this class existed.
      * tracked and absent from disk -> the BLOB recorded for it: in the index
        when ``ref`` is None, which is what ``git ls-files`` lists, or in the
        tree at ``ref`` when the consumer's subject set is a commit. Absent
        covers a sparse-checkout exclusion, a skip-worktree bit, and a file
        deleted and not yet committed alike, and in each the recorded blob is
        the file's tracked content.
      * neither -> not a file. ``is_file`` says False and ``read_bytes`` raises.

    So a sparse checkout reads exactly what a full checkout of the same commit
    reads, and the census counts the same integers in both.
