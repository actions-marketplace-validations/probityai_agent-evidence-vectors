"""The packaged readers score an indeterminate member on its readings, and only there.

An indeterminate member is one the specification leaves open: its manifest entry
lists every verdict a conforming verifier may reach, under `readings`. The agent
audit record corpus shipped N1 and N2 with `expected.verdict` pinned to one of
those readings and a note telling implementers to score on `expected.verdict`,
so a second implementation taking the other listed reading would have been
scored wrong. The packaged judge passed it because it never read the pinned
field. These cases hold both packaged readers that carry indeterminate members
to the rule, on a staged copy of each tracked corpus:

- the tracked corpus is judged clean;
- pinning `expected.verdict` on an indeterminate member is a finding, whichever
  reading is pinned;
- deleting any one listed reading is a finding, so every listed reading is
  load-bearing: the reference reader's own reading, because the reader then
  lands outside the set, and the other, because one reading is a rule and a
  member carrying a rule is not indeterminate;
- `auditrecord.conforming_verdicts` returns every listed reading for an
  indeterminate member and the one expected verdict for any other, so a second
  implementation that answers either reading of N1 is scored as conforming.

Usage: uv run --extra generators python scripts/indeterminate-readers-test.py
Exit 0 when every case holds; 1 with a summary of the failures.
