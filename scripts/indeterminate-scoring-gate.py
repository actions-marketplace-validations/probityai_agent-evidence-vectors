"""No corpus pins one expected verdict on a member whose readings allow several.

An indeterminate member records a question the specification leaves open, and
lists under `readings` what a conforming verifier may answer. Two shapes exist
in this repository and the gate reads both:

- a list, `readings: [{"verdict": ...}, ...]`, where each entry names a verdict;
- a map, `expected.readings: {name: value}`, where each value is either the
  verdict `valid` or a condition code. A condition code names a refusal, so it
  reads here as the verdict `invalid`.

Two rules follow, and each has already been broken here:

1. A member whose readings imply more than one verdict carries NO
   `expected.verdict`. Any single value there scores a verifier that takes
   another listed reading as wrong. The agent audit record corpus shipped N1
   and N2 that way, beside a note telling implementers to score on
   `expected.verdict`, and an outside reader found it before a second
   implementation ran. The observed-effect and SCITT carriage corpora carried
   the same shape.
2. A member whose readings imply exactly one verdict (the adversarial execution
   evidence corpus, where the verdict is settled and only the condition is open)
   may carry `expected.verdict`, and it must be the verdict its readings imply.

Every top-level `*/MANIFEST.json` under the root is read, so a corpus added
tomorrow is held to the rule without being registered here. A run that finds no
member declaring readings refuses: a gate quantified over nothing cannot be told
apart from a clean one.

Usage: python3 scripts/indeterminate-scoring-gate.py [--root DIR]
Exit 0 clean, 1 with one line per refusal.
