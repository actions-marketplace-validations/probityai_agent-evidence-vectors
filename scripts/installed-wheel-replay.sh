# release.yml runs this before it publishes, and ci.yml runs it on every pull
# request and every push to main. It used to live only in release.yml, so a
# corpus whose wheel copy could not find its vendored specification
# (vectors-self-reported-record, spec/self-reported-record/v1.md) passed every
# pull request and was first refused by the publish job of v0.17.8, after the
# tag was cut. The check has to run before a tag can exist.
#
# EVERY corpus the wheel ships is replayed, not only the default one, and each
# must end in one of two states: judged clean by a reader in this package, or
# refused by name (exit 2) because its suite has no reader here. A third state
# -- a verdict printed by a rail that does not implement the suite -- fails.
# The refused suites also run through the Go directory reader against the
# installed wheel data. SCITT-COSE explicitly needs a CBOR reader.
